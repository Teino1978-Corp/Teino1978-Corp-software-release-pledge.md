Software Release Pledge
=======================

*Short description: This Pledge is a commitment by software makers to empower their users with the capabilities of keeping using the software, even if it was to be discontinued.*

If our founding team ever comes to discontinue development and/or maintenance of our product (or service), we pledge:
- to inform our users at least 2 weeks before the product (or service) can no longer be used;
- and to propose a solution for them to keep using the product (or service).

These solutions include (but are not limited to): opening the source code of the product (or service), selling the Internet domain name and working server infrastructure without profit, or at least providing a way to migrate all user data and functionalities to another product (or service) for users who want it.

By signing this pledge, the name, logo and website URL of my product, service, or company will be added on the public website of the pledge.
